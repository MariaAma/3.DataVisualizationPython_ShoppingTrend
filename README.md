# Data Visualization with Python: Customer Shopping Trends

## Introduction
This project focuses on data visualization of a CSV dataset to explore customer shopping trends. We utilize Python and popular libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Customer Shopping Trends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset). 

## Data Visualization
We use Python, Pandas, Numpy Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform data analysis and visualization on the dataset. The visualizations include bar plots, scatter plots, and other relevant charts to uncover insights into customer shopping behaviors.
